        "#1.  Backtracking\n",
        "Approach: The idea is to assign dormitory one by one to different kids, starting from the index 0. Before assigning a dormitory, check for safety by considering already assigned dormitory to the kid that fight often i.e check if the kids that fight often have the same dormitory or not. If there is any dormitory assignment that does not violate the conditions, mark the dormitory assignment as part of the solution. If no assignment of dormitory is possible then backtrack and return false.\n",
